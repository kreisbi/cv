                <p>I am an Engineer, who studied Business and Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University. 
                    <br> 
                    I specialized in power systems modelling and Operations Research, 
                    <br>skills that I frequently apply
                    in my work at Consentec.

        <ul>
            <li>Redispatch Markets in Germany (<a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Publikationen/Studien/zukuenftige-redispatch-beschaffung-in-deutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6">
                Abschlussbericht</a>)</li>
            <p>In this project we looked at how a market-based incentives in the redispatch-framework would impact the redispatch in Germany. Our quantitative modelling showed that market-based
                <br>incentives could indeed trigger stratigic bidding (Gaming) that in turn would increase redispatch by a significant amount, rather than reducing it.

            <li>Defining und Monitoring of the Security of Supply at European Power Markets (<a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Publikationen/Studien/definition-und-monitoring-der-versorgungssicherheit-an-den-europaeischen-strommaerkten.pdf">
                 1. Projektbericht</a>)</li>
                 <p>Here we looked at the European power markets while focussing Germany, and assessed the level of the so-called "Loss of Load Probability" (LoLP) for future years, up until 2030.
                     <br>We concluded that even with a high share of energy beeing supplied by renewable energy assets, the LoLP remains well below cirical tresholds, which means that demand can be fullfilled
                     <br>at nearly any given point in time.
                 </p>
            <li>Impact of Bidding Zone Splits on Redispatch in CORE-Region</li>
                <p>We concluded that Bidding Zone Splits will not change the amount of congestion in the transmission grid, and therefore redispatch remain on a similar level as without them.
                    <br>The reason for this beeing that the requirements on "Minimum Remainig Margins", which stem from the Clean Energy Package, are limiting the relieving effects of a Bidding Zone Split.
